                Aloha and welcome to spring 2026 semester.<br>
                Yes, this may or may not be your course.<br>
                I am building a single introduction video for everybody.<br>
                And this first day, I'm a little behind in creating all my content.<br>
                We had some issues with a couple of the adjunct instructors that have kind of thrown everything up in the air.<br>
                And we're finally getting a handle on everything.<br>
                So when you do log in, you'll see this first page and this video will be here on this welcome page and also any real pertinent information, including the Zoom link.<br>
                I haven't put it on for this one yet, but it'll be on this page as well as in the module so that you know exactly how to connect on Zoom.<br>
                Now, the Zoom meetings are weekly.<br>
                And we'll go over everything in the course on the first, obviously, in the first Zoom session.<br>
                In general, I like to use the Zoom more as a lab time, not a lecture.<br>
                I will definitely answer any questions on material, cover anything there.<br>
                But I really want to spend the time working on labs and on the hands-on kind of activities to make sure everybody understands those and has a good handle on what we're doing in the course.<br>
                OK, and the whole course, essentially, we're going to be talking about the modules, OK?<br>
                And so in this course right now, I just really have the syllabus.<br>
                And I have a resources plan because I know textbooks.<br>
                And so you'll click on the syllabus, you'll look through the syllabus, and we'll cover the syllabus in class in that first class session.<br>
                OK, so it has all the information about the course and my info, how to contact me and the course outline of what we're going to do each week and then also the course level policies and stuff like that.<br>
                And like I said, we'll cover this in detail in the individual Zoom sessions for class.<br>
                Now, get on those Zoom sessions, they will be recorded and the recordings will be posted in every week.<br>
                So every week's module at the bottom will add a link to the Zoom recording, typically a day to two days after class.<br>
                It just depends on how fast it comes back from Zoom and also what my time's like and what I'm working on at the time.<br>
                So that's the plan.<br>
                And then depending upon the course, some courses have textbooks, some do not.<br>
                This course does not have a textbook and I have a bunch of resources that we're going to use.<br>
                And this talks about it all.<br>
                And actually, this says they're subject to change because when we go through the course, things might change just depending upon how the course goes and stuff like that.<br>
                But again, we'll talk about that in the class itself.<br>
                OK, but I just wanted to say hello. Welcome to the spring semester.<br>
                I hope you're ready for this. I'm looking forward to having a great semester.<br>
                All right, and we'll see you in the class soon.
